      <td>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 natively supports partition encryption through the Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to encrypt a partition is during installation time.  For manual installations, select the Encrypt checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots.  For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the --encrypted and --passphrase= options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition: part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=PASSPHRASE Any PASSPHRASE is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the --passphrase= option from the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.  By default, the Anaconda installer uses aes-xts-plain64 cipher with a minimum 512 bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.  Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Documentation web site:           https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Security_Guide/sec-Encryption.html.</td>

      <td>Disabling the automounter permits the administrator to statically control filesystem mounting through /etc/fstab.  Additionally, automatically mounting filesystems permits easy introduction of unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity.</td>

Operating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.  FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets industry and government requirements. For government systems, this allows Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.</td>
