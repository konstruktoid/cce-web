The ssl directive specifies whether\nto use TLS or not. If not specified it will default to no. It should be set\nto start_tls rather than doing LDAP over SSL.","566":"Unnecessary packages should not be installed to decrease the attack\nsurface of the system.  While this software is clearly essential on an LDAP\nserver, it is not necessary on typical desktop or workstation systems.","567":"If there is no need to make DNS server software available,\nremoving it provides a safeguard against its activation.","568":"All network services involve some risk of compromise due to\nimplementation flaws and should be disabled if possible.","569":"If both the primary and secondary nameserver are under your control,\nor if you have only one nameserver, it may be possible to use an external\nconfiguration management mechanism to distribute zone updates. In that case, it\nis not necessary to allow zone transfers within BIND itself, so they should be\ndisabled to avoid the potential for abuse.","570":"The BIND transaction signature (TSIG) functionality allows primary\nand secondary nameservers to use a shared secret to verify authorization to\nperform zone transfers. This method is more secure than using IP-based limiting\nto restrict nameserver access, since IP addresses can be easily spoofed.\nHowever, if you cannot configure TSIG between your servers because, for\ninstance, the secondary nameserver is not under your control and its\nadministrators are unwilling to configure TSIG, you can configure an\nallow-transfer directive with numerical IP addresses or ACLs as a last resort.","571":"Dynamic updates allow remote servers to add, delete, or modify any\nentries in your zone file. Therefore, they should be considered highly risky,\nand disabled unless there is a very good reason for their use. If dynamic\nupdates must be allowed, IP-based ACLs are insufficient protection, since they\nare easily spoofed. Instead, use TSIG keys (see the previous section for an\nexample), and consider using the update-policy directive to restrict changes to\nonly the precise type of change needed."},"Impact":{"0":"medium","1":"medium","2":"medium","3":"medium","4":"medium","5":"low","6":"medium","7":"unknown","8":"medium","9":"unknown","10":"medium","11":"unknown","12":"unknown","13":"low","14":"medium","15":"medium","16":"medium","17":"medium","18":"unknown","19":"unknown","20":"unknown","21":"unknown","22":"unknown","23":"unknown","24":"unknown","25":"unknown","26":"unknown","27":"medium","28":"medium","29":"medium","30":"medium","31":"medium","32":"unknown","33":"high","34":"medium","35":"medium","36":"unknown","37":"medium","38":"medium","39":"unknown","40":"medium","41":"medium","42":"medium","43":"medium","44":"high","45":"low","46":"medium","47":"medium","48":"medium","49":"medium","50":"medium","51":"medium","52":"medium","53":"medium","54":"medium","55":"high","56":"low","57":"medium","58":"medium","59":"unknown","60":"medium","61":"medium","62":"medium","63":"medium","64":"medium","65":"medium","66":"medium","67":"medium","68":"medium","69":"medium","70":"medium","71":"medium","72":"medium","73":"medium","74":"medium","75":"medium","76":"medium","77":"medium","78":"medium","79":"medium","80":"medium","81":"medium","82":"medium","83":"medium","84":"medium","85":"medium","86":"medium","87":"medium","88":"medium","89":"medium","90":"medium","91":"medium","92":"medium","93":"medium","94":"medium","95":"medium","96":"medium","97":"medium","98":"medium","99":"medium","100":"medium","101":"medium","102":"medium","103":"medium","104":"medium","105":"medium","106":"medium","107":"medium","108":"medium","109":"medium","110":"medium","111":"medium","112":"medium","113":"medium","114":"medium","115":"medium","116":"medium","117":"medium","118":"medium","119":"medium","120":"medium","121":"medium","122":"medium","123":"medium","124":"medium","125":"medium","126":"medium","127":"medium","128":"medium","129":"medium","130":"medium","131":"medium","132":"medium","133":"medium","134":"medium","135":"medium","136":"medium","137":"medium","138":"medium","139":"medium","140":"medium","141":"medium","142":"medium","143":"medium","144":"medium","145":"medium","146":"medium","147":"medium","148":"medium","149":"medium","150":"medium","151":"medium","152":"medium","153":"medium","154":"medium","155":"medium","156":"medium","157":"medium","158":"medium","159":"medium","160":"medium","161":"medium","162":"medium","163":"medium","164":"medium","165":"medium","166":"medium","167":"medium","168":"medium","169":"medium","170":"medium","171":"medium","172":"medium","173":"medium","174":"medium","175":"medium","176":"medium","177":"medium","178":"high","179":"high","180":"high","181":"medium","182":"medium","183":"high","184":"medium","185":"medium","186":"medium","187":"medium","188":"low","189":"medium","190":"medium","191":"medium","192":"medium","193":"low","194":"low","195":"low","196":"low","197":"low","198":"low","199":"low","200":"medium","201":"low","202":"low","203":"low","204":"low","205":"low","206":"low","207":"low","208":"low","209":"low","210":"high","211":"medium","212":"high","213":"high","214":"high","215":"high","216":"medium","217":"medium","218":"medium","219":"unknown","220":"medium","221":"unknown","222":"unknown","223":"medium","224":"medium","225":"unknown","226":"medium","227":"medium","228":"medium","229":"medium","230":"medium","231":"medium","232":"medium","233":"unknown","234":"medium","235":"unknown","236":"medium","237":"unknown","238":"medium","239":"unknown","240":"medium","241":"unknown","242":"unknown","243":"unknown","244":"medium","245":"medium","246":"medium","247":"medium","248":"unknown","249":"medium","250":"medium","251":"medium","252":"medium","253":"unknown","254":"medium","255":"medium","256":"medium","257":"medium","258":"unknown","259":"medium","260":"medium","261":"medium","262":"medium","263":"medium","264":"medium","265":"medium","266":"medium","267":"medium","268":"medium","269":"medium","270":"low","271":"medium","272":"medium","273":"medium","274":"medium","275":"unknown","276":"medium","277":"unknown","278":"unknown","279":"medium","280":"unknown","281":"medium","282":"medium","283":"unknown","284":"medium","285":"unknown","286":"medium","287":"unknown","288":"unknown","289":"unknown","290":"medium","291":"medium","292":"medium","293":"medium","294":"low","295":"medium","296":"medium","297":"medium","298":"unknown","299":"medium","300":"medium","301":"unknown","302":"unknown","303":"medium","304":"low","305":"low","306":"low","307":"low","308":"low","309":"low","310":"unknown","311":"medium","312":"unknown","313":"low","314":"unknown","315":"low","316":"unknown","317":"medium","318":"medium","319":"medium","320":"unknown","321":"medium","322":"medium","323":"medium","324":"medium","325":"medium","326":"medium","327":"medium","328":"medium","329":"medium","330":"medium","331":"medium","332":"medium","333":"medium","334":"medium","335":"medium","336":"medium","337":"medium","338":"medium","339":"medium","340":"medium","341":"medium","342":"medium","343":"medium"
