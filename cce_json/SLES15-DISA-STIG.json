Additionally,Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and operational information mustnot be revealed through error messages to unauthorized personnel or theirdesignated representatives.","202":"Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting thetools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audittools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.SUSE operating systems providing tools to interface with audit informationwill leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing thetools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys to make access decisionsregarding the access to audit tools.","203":"Without the capability to restrict which roles and individuals can selectwhich events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent theauditing of critical events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system'sperformance by overwhelming the audit log. Misconfigured audits may alsomake it more difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the eventsrelating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.","204":"Exposing kernel pointers (through procfs or seq_printf()) exposeskernel writeable structures that can contain functions pointers. If a write vulnereability occursin the kernel allowing a write access to any of this structure, the kernel can be compromise. Thisoption disallow any program withtout the CAP_SYSLOG capability from getting the kernel pointers addresses,replacing them with 0.","205":"Address space layout randomization (ASLR) makes it more difficult for anattacker to predict the location of attack code they have introduced into aprocess's address space during an attempt at exploitation. Additionally,ASLR makes it more difficult for an attacker to know the location ofexisting code in order to re-purpose it using return oriented programming(ROP) techniques.","206":"Kernel core dumps may contain the full contents of system memory at thetime of the crash. Kernel core dumps consume a considerable amount of diskspace and may result in denial of service by exhausting the available spaceon the target file system partition. Unless the system is used for kerneldevelopment or testing, there is little need to run the kdump service.","207":"Removing the vsftpd package decreases the risk of itsaccidental activation.","208":"A number of system services utilize email messages sent to the root user tonotify system administrators of active or impending issues. These messages mustbe forwarded to at least one monitored email address.","209":"The noexec mount option causes the system not to execute binary files. This option must be usedfor mounting any file system not containing approved binary files as they may be incompatible. Executingfiles from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorizedadministrative access.","210":"NFS mounts should not present suid binaries to users. Only vendor-supplied suid executablesshould be installed to their default location on the local filesystem.","211":"Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlateevents and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correcttime a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conductingforensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside theconfigured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.","212":"The shosts.equiv files are used to configure host-based authentication for thesystem via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventingunauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactiveidentification and authentication of a connection request, or for the use oftwo-factor authentication.","213":"The .shosts files are used to configure host-based authentication forindividual users or the system via SSH. Host-based authentication is notsufficient for preventing unauthorized access to the system, as it does notrequire interactive identification and authentication of a connection request,or for the use of two-factor authentication.","214":"It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default,functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. Theseunnecessary capabilities are often overlooked and therefore may remainunsecure. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additionalattack vectors.The telnet service provides an unencrypted remote access service which doesnot provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or theremote session. If a privileged user were to login using this service, theprivileged user password could be compromised.Removing the telnet-server package decreases the risk of thetelnet service's accidental (or intentional) activation.","215":"If compression is allowed in an SSH connection prior to authentication,vulnerabilities in the compression software could result in compromise of thesystem from an unauthenticated connection, potentially with root privileges.","216":"Configuring this setting for the SSH daemon provides additional assurancethat remote login via SSH will require a password, even in the event ofmisconfiguration elsewhere.","217":"Even though the communications channel may be encrypted, an additional layer ofsecurity is gained by extending the policy of not logging directly on as root.In addition, logging in with a user-specific account provides individualaccountability of actions performed on the system and also helps to minimizedirect attack attempts on root's password.","218":"Configuring this setting for the SSH daemon provides additionalassurance that remote login via SSH will require a password, evenin the event of misconfiguration elsewhere.","219":"Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers ofusers who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised byother users on the X11 server. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled,users can always install their own forwarders.","220":"SSH environment options potentially allow users to bypassaccess restriction in some configurations.","221":"If other users have access to modify user-specific SSH configuration files, theymay be able to log into the system as another user.","222":"The warning message reinforces policy awareness during the logon process andfacilitates possible legal action against attackers. Alternatively, systemswhose ownership should not be obvious should ensure usage of a banner that doesnot provide easy attribution.","223":"Providing users feedback on when account accesses last occurred facilitates userrecognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.","224":"Terminating an idle ssh session within a short time period reduces the window ofopportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management sessionenabled on the console or console port that has been let unattended.","225":"This ensures a user login will be terminated as soon as the ClientAliveIntervalis reached.","226":"SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specificallynot recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it providesso much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. INFO orVERBOSE level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In manysituations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was activeon a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow thefield.","227":"Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified and thereforecannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised.Operating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating tocryptographic modules.FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modulesutilize authentication that meets industry and government requirements. For government systems, this allowsSecurity Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15.","228":"DoD Information Systems are required to use FIPS-approved cryptographic hashfunctions. The only SSHv2 hash algorithms meeting this requirement is SHA2.","229":"Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality, andintegrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can beintercepted and either read or altered.This checklist item applies to both internal and external networks and all typesof information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers,mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, etc). Communication pathsoutside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibilityof interception and modification.","230":"If an unauthorized user obtains the private SSH host
