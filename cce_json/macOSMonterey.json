These records aid an organization in their efforts to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.\n\nThe content required to be captured in an audit record varies based on the impact level of an organization's system. Content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source addresses, destination addresses, user identifiers, event descriptions, success\/fail indications, filenames involved, and access or flow control rules invoked.\n\nThe information system initiates session audits at system start-up.\n\nNOTE: Security auditing is enabled by default on macOS.\n","11":"The audit service _MUST_ be configured to notify the system administrator when the amount of free disk space remaining reaches an organization defined value. \n\nThis rule ensures that the system administrator is notified in advance that action is required to free up more disk space for audit logs.\n","12":"\/etc\/security\/audit_control _MUST_ not contain Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n","13":"\/etc\/security\/audit_control _MUST_ have the group set to wheel.\n","14":"\/etc\/security\/audit_control _MUST_ be configured so that it is readable only by the root user and group wheel.\n","15":"\/etc\/security\/audit_control _MUST_ have the owner set to root.\n","16":"The audit service _MUST_ be configured to shut down the computer if it is unable to audit system events. \n\nOnce audit failure occurs, user and system activity are no longer recorded, and malicious activity could go undetected.

Such a capability greatly reduces the risk that operating system accessibility will be negatively affected for extended periods of time and also provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.\n\nTo enable notifications and audit logging of removed accounts, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed this requirement. \n","280":"The macOS should be configured to automatically notify system administrators, Information System Security Officers (ISSOs), and (IMOs) when baseline configurations are modified.\n\nUnauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may  present security threats. Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the state of the operating system. \n\nTo enable notifications and audit logging of changes made to baseline configurations, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed this requirement. \n","281":"The macOS should be configured to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by enforcing rate-limiting measures on network interfaces. \n\nDoS attacks leave authorized users unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor. When this occurs, the organization must operate at degraded capacity; often resulting in an inability to accomplish its mission. \n\nTo prevent DoS attacks by ensuring rate-limiting measures on network interfaces, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level firewalls and networking equipment that meet or exceed this requirement.\n","282":"The organization should employ automated mechanisms to support the management of information system accounts.\n\nThe use of automated mechanisms prevents against human error and provide a faster and more efficient means of relaying time-sensitive information and account management.\n\nTo employ automated mechanisms for account management functions, many operating systems can be integrated with an enterprise-level directory service that meets or exceeds this requirement.\n","283":"The macOS should be configured to require users to reauthenticate when the device authenticator is changed. \n\nWithout reauthentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they are not authorization. When operating systems provide the capability to change device authenticators, it is critical the device reauthenticate.\n","284":"The information system requests and performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the name\/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.\n\nNOTE: macOS supports encrypted DNS settings with the com.apple.dnsSettings.managed payload, however, the system must be integrated with a DNS server that supports encrypted DNS. link:https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/devicemanagement\/dnssettings[]\n","285":"The macOS should be configured to require users to change at least 50% of the characters when setting a new password. \n\nIf the operating system allows users to consecutively reuse extensive portions of passwords, this increases the window of opportunity for a malicious user to guess the password. The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. In other words, characters may be the same within the two passwords; however, the positions of the like characters must be different.\n\nTo enforce a 50% character change when new passwords are created, many operating systems can be integrated with an enterprise-level directory service that meets or exceeds this requirement. \n","286":"The macOS should be configured to forbid users to use dictionary words for passwords. \n\nIf the operating system allows users to select passwords based on dictionary words, this increases the window of opportunity for a malicious user to guess the password. \n\nTo prevent users from using dictionary words for passwords, many operating systems can be integrated with an enterprise-level directory service that meets or exceeds this requirement.\n","287":"The macOS should be configured to automatically disable Wi-Fi when connected to ethernet. \n\nThe use of Wi-Fi to connect to unauthorized networks may facilitate the exfiltration of mission data. Therefore, wireless networking capabilities internally embedded within information system components should be disabled when not intended to be used. \n\nNOTE: If the system requires Wi-Fi to connect to an authorized network, this is not applicable.\n","288":"A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and\/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook\/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.\n\nDue to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.\n\nUsage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.\n","289":"The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).\n","290":"Check the validity of the following information inputs: organization-defined information inputs to the systems.\n\nChecking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs\u2014including character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values\u2014verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of \"387,\" \"abc,\" or \"%K%\" are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n","291":"Route remote accesses through authorized and managed network access control points.\n\nOrganizations consider the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative requirements for external network connections since limiting the number of access control points for remote access reduces attack surfaces.\n","292":"Provide irrefutable evidence that an individual (or process acting on behalf of an individual) has performed organization-defined actions to be covered by non-repudiation.\n\nTypes of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include creating information, sending and receiving messages, and approving information. Non-repudiation protects against claims by authors of not having authored certain documents, senders of not having transmitted messages, receivers of not having received messages, and signatories of not having signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an individual or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request, or receiving specific information). Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms, including digital signatures and digital message receipts.\n","293":"Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network or an internal network.  \n","294":"Remove the following elements of personally identifiable information from datasets: organization-defined elements of personally identifiable information and evaluate organization-defined frequency for effectiveness of de-identification.\n\nDe-identification is the general term for the process of removing the association between a set of identifying data and the data subject. Many datasets contain information about individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records. Datasets may also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable information is removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or no longer) necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example, if the dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that are not needed for producing those statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection since information that is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used. Organizations may be subject to specific de-identification definitions or methods under applicable laws, regulations, or policies. Re-identification is a residual risk with de-identified data. Re-identification attacks can vary, including combining new datasets or other improvements in data analytics. Maintaining awareness of potential attacks and evaluating for the effectiveness of the de-identification over time support the management of this residual risk.\n","295":"Check the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of personally identifiable information across the information life cycle organization-defined frequency; and correct or delete inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable information.\n\nPersonally identifiable information quality operations include the steps that organizations take to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable information throughout the information life cycle. The information life cycle includes the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal of personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information quality operations include editing and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into systems using automated address verification look-up application programming interfaces. Checking personally identifiable information quality includes the tracking of updates or changes to data over time, which enables organizations to know how and what personally identifiable information was changed should erroneous information be identified. The measures taken to protect personally identifiable information quality are based on the nature and context of the personally identifiable information, how it is to be used, how it was obtained, and the potential de-identification methods employed. The measures taken to validate the accuracy of personally identifiable information used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals covered under federal programs may be more comprehensive than the measures used to validate personally identifiable information used for less sensitive purposes.\n","296":"Implement the privacy principle of minimization using organization-defined processes.\n\nThe principle of minimization states that organizations should only process personally identifiable information that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish an authorized purpose and should only maintain personally identifiable information for as long as is necessary to accomplish the purpose. Organizations have processes in place, consistent with applicable laws and policies, to implement the principle of minimization.\n"},"Mechanism":{"0":"Script","1":"Script","2":"Script","3":"Configuration Profile","4":"Configuration Profile","5":"Configuration Profile","6":"Configuration
