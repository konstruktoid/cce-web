Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.\n\nAlthough the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved. \n\nEmergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.\n\nTo address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication\/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.\n\nIf temporary or emergency user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary or emergency accounts _MUST_ be set to 72 hours (or less) when the temporary or emergency account is created.\n\nIf no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the \"pwpolicy\" utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set.\n\nIf there are no temporary or emergency accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.\n","142":"The macOS _MUST_ be configured to require at least one uppercase character be used when a password is created.\n\nThis rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users. \n\nNOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined.

Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.\n\nAlthough the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved. \n\nEmergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.\n\nTo address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication\/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.\n","261":"The macOS is able to be configured to force users to change their password at next logon.\n\nTemporary passwords are often used for new users when accounts are created. However, once logged in to the system, users must be immediately prompted to change to a permanent password of their creation.\n\nFor a user to change their password at next logon, run the following command:\n[source,bash]\n----\n\/usr\/bin\/pwpolicy -u [USER] -setpolicy \"newPasswordRequired=1\"\n----\nNOTE: Replace [USER] with the username that must change the password at next logon\n","262":"The macOS is able to be configured to set an automated termination for 72 hours or less for all temporary accounts upon account creation. \n\nIf temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts _MUST_ be set to 72 hours (or less) when the temporary account is created.\n\nIf no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the \"pwpolicy\" utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set.\n\nIf there are no temporary accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.\n","263":"It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected. Audit processing failures include software\/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.\n","264":"All bulk manipulation of audit information should be authorized via automatic processes, and any manual manipulation of audit information should require dual authorization. In addition, dual authorization mechanisms should require the approval of two authorized individuals before being executed.\n\nAn authorized user may intentionally or accidentally move or delete audit records without those specific actions being authorized, which would result in the loss of information that could, in the future, be critical for forensic investigation.\n\nTo enforce dual authorization before audit information can be moved or deleted, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed this requirement. \n","265":"Audit records should be off-loaded onto a different system or media from the system being audited.\n\nInformation stored in only one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration. Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity. \n\nTo secure audit records by off-loading, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed this requirement. \n","266":"The macOS should be configured to provide and implement the capability to process, sort, and search audit records for events of interest based on organizationally defined fields.\n\nEvents of interest can be identified by the content of audit records, including system resources involved, information objects accessed, identities of individuals, event types, event locations, event dates and times, Internet Protocol addresses involved, or event success or failure. Organizations may define event criteria to any degree of granularity required, such as locations selectable by a general networking location or by specific system component.\n","267":"Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type\/device. Information systems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol [TCP\/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify\/authenticate devices on local and\/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems. Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability.\n","268":"The macOS system _MUST_ be configured to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation.\n","269":"The macOS should be configured to limit the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. \n\nDoS attacks leave authorized users unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor. When this occurs, the organization must operate at degraded capacity; often resulting in an inability to accomplish its mission. \n\nTo limit the impact of DoS attacks, organizations may choose to employ increased capacity and service redundancy, which has the potential to reduce systems' susceptibility to some DoS attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing selected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning. Many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level firewalls and networking equipment that meet or exceed this requirement.\n","270":"The macOS should be configured to automatically notify system administrators and Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) when new accounts are created.\n\nOnce an attacker establishes initial access to a system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent method of reestablishing and maintaining access by creating a new account. Configuring the information system to send a notification when new accounts are created is one method for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process should not only notify when new accounts are created, but also maintain an audit record of accounts made. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes. \n\nTo enable notifications and audit logging of accounts created, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed this requirement. \n","271":"The macOS should be configured to automatically notify system administrators and Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) when accounts are disabled.\n\nWhen operating system accounts are disabled, user accessibility is affected. Accounts are utilized for identifying individual operating system users or for identifying the operating system processes themselves.

The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. In other words, characters may be the same within the two passwords; however, the positions of the like characters must be different.\n\nTo enforce a 50% character change when new passwords are created, many operating systems can be integrated with an enterprise-level directory service that meets or exceeds this requirement. \n","282":"The macOS should be configured to forbid users to use dictionary words for passwords. \n\nIf the operating system allows users to select passwords based on dictionary words, this increases the window of opportunity for a malicious user to guess the password. \n\nTo prevent users from using dictionary words for passwords, many operating systems can be integrated with an enterprise-level directory service that meets or exceeds this requirement.\n","283":"The macOS should be configured to automatically disable Wi-Fi when connected to ethernet. \n\nThe use of Wi-Fi to connect to unauthorized networks may facilitate the exfiltration of mission data. Therefore, wireless networking capabilities internally embedded within information system components should be disabled when not intended to be used. \n\nNOTE: If the system requires Wi-Fi to connect to an authorized network, this is not applicable.\n","284":"A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and\/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook\/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.\n\nDue to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.\n\nUsage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.\n","285":"The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).\n","286":"Check the validity of the following information inputs: organization-defined information inputs to the systems.\n\nChecking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs\u2014including character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values\u2014verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of \"387,\" \"abc,\" or \"%K%\" are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n","287":"Route remote accesses through authorized and managed network access control points.\n\nOrganizations consider the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative requirements for external network connections since limiting the number of access control points for remote access reduces attack surfaces.\n","288":"Provide irrefutable evidence that an individual (or process acting on behalf of an individual) has performed organization-defined actions to be covered by non-repudiation.\n\nTypes of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include creating information, sending and receiving messages, and approving information. Non-repudiation protects against claims by authors of not having authored certain documents, senders of not having transmitted messages, receivers of not having received messages, and signatories of not having signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an individual or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request, or receiving specific information). Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms, including digital signatures and digital message receipts.\n","289":"Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network or an internal network.  \n","290":"Remove the following elements of personally identifiable information from datasets: organization-defined elements of personally identifiable information and evaluate organization-defined frequency for effectiveness of de-identification.\n\nDe-identification is the general term for the process of removing the association between a set of identifying data and the data subject. Many datasets contain information about individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records. Datasets may also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable information is removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or no longer) necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example, if the dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that are not needed for producing those statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection since information that is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used. Organizations may be subject to specific de-identification definitions or methods under applicable laws, regulations, or policies. Re-identification is a residual risk with de-identified data. Re-identification attacks can vary, including combining new datasets or other improvements in data analytics. Maintaining awareness of potential attacks and evaluating for the effectiveness of the de-identification over time support the management of this residual risk.\n","291":"Check the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of personally identifiable information across the information life cycle organization-defined frequency; and correct or delete inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable information.\n\nPersonally identifiable information quality operations include the steps that organizations take to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable information throughout the information life cycle. The information life cycle includes the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal of personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information quality operations include editing and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into systems using automated address verification look-up application programming interfaces. Checking personally identifiable information quality includes the tracking of updates or changes to data over time, which enables organizations to know how and what personally identifiable information was changed should erroneous information be identified. The measures taken to protect personally identifiable information quality are based on the nature and context of the personally identifiable information, how it is to be used, how it was obtained, and the potential de-identification methods employed. The measures taken to validate the accuracy of personally identifiable information used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals covered under federal programs may be more comprehensive than the measures used to validate personally identifiable information used for less sensitive purposes.\n","292":"Implement the privacy principle of minimization using organization-defined processes.\n\nThe principle of minimization states that organizations should only process personally identifiable information that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish an authorized purpose and should only maintain personally identifiable information for as long as is necessary to accomplish the purpose.
