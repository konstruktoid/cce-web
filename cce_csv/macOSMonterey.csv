Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.

Although the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved. 

Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.

To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.

If temporary or emergency user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary or emergency accounts _MUST_ be set to 72 hours (or less) when the temporary or emergency account is created.

If no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the ""pwpolicy"" utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set.

If there are no temporary or emergency accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.
",Manual,"Verify if a password policy is enforced by a directory service by asking the System Administrator (SA) or Information System Security Officer (ISSO). 

If no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the ""pwpolicy"" utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set. 

If there are no temporary or emergency accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.

To check if the password policy is configured to disable a temporary or emergency account after 72 hours, run the following command to output the password policy to the screen, substituting the correct user name in place of username:

/usr/bin/pwpolicy -u username getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2

If there is no output, and password policy is not controlled by a directory service, this is a finding.

Otherwise, look for the line ""<key>policyCategoryAuthentication</key>"".

In the array that follows, there should be a <dict> section that contains a check <string> that allows users to log in if ""policyAttributeCurrentTime"" is less than the result of adding ""policyAttributeCreationTime"" to 72 hours (259299 seconds).

Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit log information and organizes it into a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same system or from the same organizational entities that conduct audit logging activities. The audit record reduction capability includes modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be an issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient.

Audit record reduction and report generation can be done with tools built into macOS such as auditreduce and praudit. These tools are protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP).

CCE-90947-3,os_malicious_code_prevention,Ensure the System Implements Malicious Code Protection Mechanisms,"The inherent configuration of the macOS _IS_ in compliance as Apple has designed the system with three layers of protection against malware. Each layer of protection is comprised of one or more malicious code protection mechanisms, which are automatically implemented and which, collectively, meet the requirements of all applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for malicious code prevention.

1. This  first layer of defense targets the distribution of malware; the aim is to prevent malware from ever launching. 
The following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the first layer of protection against malicious code: 
*	The Apple App Store: the safest way to add new applications to a Mac is by downloading them from the App Store; all apps available for download from the App Store have been reviewed for signs of tampering and signed by Apple to indicate that the app meets security requirements and does not contain malware. 
*	XProtect: a built-in, signature-based, anti-virus, anti-malware technology inherent to all Macs. XProtect automatically detects and blocks the execution of known malware. 
  *	In macOS 10.15 and all subsequent releases, XProtect checks for known malicious content when:
    *	an app is first launched,
    *	an app has been changed (in the file system), and
    *	XProtect signatures are updated.
*	YARA: another built-in tool (inherent to all Macs), which conducts signature-based detection of malware. Apple updates YARA rules regularly.
*	Gatekeeper: a security feature inherent to all Macs; Gatekeeper scans apps to detect malware and/or revocations of a developer's signing certificate and prevents unsafe apps from running.
*	Notarization: Apple performs regular, automated scans to detect signs of malicious content and to verify developer ID-signed software; when no issues are found, Apple notarizes the software and delivers the results of scans to the system owner. 

2. The second layer of defense targets malware that manages to appear on a Mac before it runs; the aim is to quickly identify and block any malware present on a Mac in order to prevent the malware from running and further spreading. 
The following mechanisms are inherent to the macOS design and constitute the second layer of protection against malicious code: 
*	XProtect (defined above).
*	Gatekeeper (defined above).
*	Notarization (defined above).

3.  The third layer of defense targets infected Mac system(s); the aim is to remediate Macs on which malware has managed to successfully execute. 
The following mechanism is inherent to the macOS design and constitutes the third layer of protection against malicious code: 
*	Apple's Malware Removal Tool (MRT): a technology included on all macOS systems. MRT is an agent that remediates based on automatic updates delivered from Apple. MRT will remove the malware upon receiving updated information and check for malware on restart and login.

CCE-91032-3,pwpolicy_emergency_accounts_disable,Automatically Remove or Disable Emergency Accounts within 72 Hours,"The macOS is able to be configured to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours or less. 

Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts established in response to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled, system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.

Although the ability to create and use emergency administrator accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is resolved. 

Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.

To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.

Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.

Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system.

Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs—including character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values—verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of ""387,"" ""abc,"" or ""%K%"" are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

De-identification is the general term for the process of removing the association between a set of identifying data and the data subject. Many datasets contain information about individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records. Datasets may also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information. Personally identifiable information is removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or no longer) necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example, if the dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics, the identifiers that are not needed for producing those statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection since information that is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used. Organizations may be subject to specific de-identification definitions or methods under applicable laws, regulations, or policies. Re-identification is a residual risk with de-identified data. Re-identification attacks can vary, including combining new datasets or other improvements in data analytics. Maintaining awareness of potential attacks and evaluating for the effectiveness of the de-identification over time support the management of this residual risk.
